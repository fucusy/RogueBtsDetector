This is the app resulting from google's mapview android tutorial.

TODO:
	
	- retrieve cellular LocationProvider(s) information.
	- retrieve some other LocationProvider (GPS, wifi) to cross reference BTS data
	- show current location on map with an Overlay
	- show sorrounding LocationProviders with Overlays
	- verify BTS data
		- query google for IDs retrieved from LocationProviders
			- ID not found
			- ID location incorrect
		- ??? - Think hard here
	- Notify user of any BTS stations
	- Can we turn on airplane mode automagically?
